## Background

The [carpet-plot](https://github.com/petrslavotinek/grafana-carpetplot) panel plugin is one of the most used plugins for Grafana. Unfortunately, it's no longer being actively maintained.

Grafana 7.0 introduced a new plugin architecture based on React. Instead of migrating the original plugin from Angular, this is completely rewritten from scratch, using inspiration from the original plugin.
